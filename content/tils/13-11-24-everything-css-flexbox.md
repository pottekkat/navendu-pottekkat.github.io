My working with CSS is mostly trying every value for a property until it does what I want it to do. This ignorance has only increased with free access to GitHub Copilot in my IDE, where I conveniently delegate CSS specifics to the AI.

But today, I found [the BEST interactive tutorial about Flexbox](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/). Even a quick look can help you intuitively understand how to use the Flexbox properly. Very good, very recommend.
