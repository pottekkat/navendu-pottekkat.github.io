When combining multiple jq filters, you can use jq's inbuilt pipe `|` operator instead of shell pipes.

i.e., instead of this:

```shell
curl 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users' | jq \
'.[]' | jq 'select(.address.city == "South Christy")' | jq '{name, username, email}'
```

You can do this:

```shell
curl 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users' | jq \
'.[] | select(.address.city == "South Christy") | {name, username, email}'
```
