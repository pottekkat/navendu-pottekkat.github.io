Here's what I'm doing now.

## Full-Time Job

I work full-time at [API7.ai](https://api7.ai/), where I help build [Apache APISIX](https://apisix.apache.org/).

Apache APISIX is an open source, high-performance, cloud native API gateway.

I work to ensure that APISIX's users have the best experience using APISIX. I also travel a lot to talk to more people about APISIX.

## Blog and Newsletter

I write on this blog about my work and my other projects. I also send [occasional newsletters](/subscribe/) to a couple of hundred people.

I don't plan to work on these full-time or scale and monetize them, at least for now.

## Reading

I'm currently reading [V K N\'s collected short stories](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17971843-v-k-n).

I'm also reading [The Anarchy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42972023-the-anarchy) by William Dalrymple. It talks about the East India Company and how it rose to power against Indian kingdoms.

I like learning history. I'm terrible at it, and I have been improving my knowledge by reading more history books.

I have also been using [Readwise](https://readwise.io/i/navendu4) for articles and newsletters. It works really well. I will create a public list of my subscriptions soon.

## Side Projects and Hobbies

I'm not working on any side projects now. But I have a big "Ideas" document that I find myself updating constantly.

A lot of my hobbies, like playing my bass guitar, have reduced significantly. I plan to spend more time on my hobbies after a few months.
