[Micro-retirement](https://code.likeagirl.io/micro-retirement-a-new-way-to-live-36fd5c4611a9) is a nice way to formalize the idea of taking "breaks" from typical jobs to pursue things you want in life. This means instead of working until you are old, saving up for retirement, and then using your "freedom" to do things you actually want, you do them now when you are younger and healthier.

I want to do a lot of things. I have come to the conclusion that I don't want to live a typical life grinding at jobs I don't like because I have to. I have come to the conclusion that I want to be doing the things I want in life as much as I can. That could mean times when I'm unemployed, making no money, or times when I'm randomly pursuing things for the sake of pursuit. I have come to the conclusion that all these would get me to where I want to go in life.

I have finished reading Nitin Pai's translation of the ancient Indian text, _[The Nitopadesha](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/75515336-the-nitopadesha)_. The ideas from the book are timeless and appear even in contemporary microeconomics textbooks. I'm writing a four-part series on the book, which connects its ideas to solving present-day problems.
