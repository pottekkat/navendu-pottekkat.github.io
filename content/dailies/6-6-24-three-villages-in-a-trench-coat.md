While walking around Bratislava, you constantly remind yourself that you are in a capital city when all around you feel the warmth and coziness of a small village.

People (I mean everyone) are relaxed and appear less busy, which is not characteristic of a capital city. Even when I compare it with cities like Vienna and Budapest, Bratislava still resonates with the beautiful melancholy of a past that the rest of the world seems to have forgotten.

I asked a resident about this feature of the city, and he agreed. I have to say Iâ€™m a bit envious of being able to live like that.

ApacheCon was pretty good, albeit smaller than I expected. I got to meet people I have known for years in real life.

I also took a short trip to Budapest and Vienna before flying home. Here are some of the highlights.

I took the "Before Sunrise" tour of Vienna and walked through all the landmarks in the city, as in the movie.
