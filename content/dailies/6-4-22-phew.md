With what happened yesterday, everything was in turmoil today.

I had two meetings todayâ€”which is less compared to the number of meetings I had beforeâ€”but I also had a lot of work to do on top of the turmoil. I wish there were more hours in the day. I could also live with less tiredness/less time to recharge.

The day is done. _Phew!_
