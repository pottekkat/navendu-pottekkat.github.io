Sometimes, the internet makes you pause.

Every sometimes, I come across interesting places and people on the internet, and I HAVE TO DROP EVERYTHING to check it/them out. Today was such a day.

I found this blog post by Tom Hazledine titled "[Mapping LLM embeddings in three dimensions](https://tomhazledine.com/mapping-llm-embeddings-in-3d/)" and ended up binging his blog.

The posts are excellent, and the blog looks neat and has a lot of personality.

My aspirations with this blog are similar. I'd like to believe it shows some personality even though I'm incompetent to build a novel website style from scratch.

Still, I have put a lot of effort into making these pages on the internet look and feel like I want.
