I'm a hypocrite.

While I was RAGING in [my last daily logs](/dailies/7-5-24-ocd/), I'm much more at peace today for almost the same reasons. I could even say I'm in joy.

I enjoy tweaking my website to match my taste. I enjoy having the knowledge and skill to fill these empty pixels just how I want. I enjoy how annoyed I get when just one of these pixels is awry.

I'm a hypocrite.

I COULD ALSO GO ON RAGES WHEN THESE HAPPEN.

But most of the time, it is the former.

I enjoy being a hypocrite.
