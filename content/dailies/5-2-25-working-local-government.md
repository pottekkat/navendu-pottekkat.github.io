This would likely be the hardest thing I've ever done.

Welcome to the day in the life of a twenty-eight-year-old who wanted to improve his small town in suburban Kerala and volunteered to help the local government.

While I did not have any expectations of how I would be able to get things done with the glacial pace of the Indian bureaucracy, the extent to which it is woven into the system would have been beyond my wildest expectations.

It's built on a foundation of incompetence. Throwing money moves things a little, but the house still would look ugly and lopsided.

The nature of the work is more managerial than engineering. I would be working with different stakeholders to bring about practical projects in the town to improve the lives of those living here. My job is to navigate the bureaucracy and get things done against the inertial unwillingness of most people involved.

Stay tuned.
