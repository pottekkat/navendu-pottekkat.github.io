I saw this shareholder letter titled "[Differentitation is Survival and the Universe Wants You to be Typical](https://x.com/aaditsh/status/1891245839990866040/photo/1)" from Jeff Bezos of Amazon while doomscrolling Twitter.

I had a similar conversation just yesterday with my younger friend in her early twenties. I told her that _most_ advice is for the average person. If you follow average advice, it won't be a surprise if you have an average life.

To live to your potential, you must strive to be different while society tries hard to keep you conformed. It is scary. It is risky. But most average advice won't apply to such people.

I stumbled across this [banger from David Sivers](https://sive.rs/futures) again. I realized it hadn't resonated with me as much as it did today.

I have a similar philosophy in life called "alternate lives." There are futures I imagine for myself, both plausible and some that require a lot of sacrifices to be plausible.

The implausible ones are hard to let go of, but I have grown to find solace in the plausible existence of infinite universes where I'm simultaneously living these lives. Or, there's always an afterlife and reincarnation.
