AAAAAAAH!

I'M WRITING THIS IN RAGE.

I HAVE WASTED ALL MY FREE TIME IN THE LAST THREE DAYS TWEAKING THE LOOK OF MY BLOG, AND I'M STUCK ON THIS WEIRD ISSUE THAT ISN'T ACTUALLY AN ISSUE, BUT MY OCD BRAIN CAN'T GET AROUND IT.

DO YOU SEE THE LOGO ON THE TOP LEFT CORNER OF THE PAGE? IT IS AN SVG, AND IT LOOKS FINE EVERYWHERE EXCEPT ON SAFARI ON MY EXTERNAL MONITOR.

IT MIGHT HAVE TO DO WITH HOW SAFARI RENDERS CONTENT ON DIFFERENT PIXEL DENSITIES. STILL, IT IS AN ISSUE REGARDLESS, AND I CANNOT FIX IT.

I WROTE ABOUT IT IN MY BIWEEKLY NEWSLETTER, THINKING THAT RANTING WOULD HELP. BUT IT DIDN'T, AND I SPENT ALL NIGHT YESTERDAY TRYING TO FIX THE PROBLEM.

THE RESULT IS MANAGEABLE FOR MOST PEOPLE, BUT IT HURTS MY BRAIN. THE FACT THAT IT IS INCONSISTENT BETWEEN SAFARI AND MY CHROMIUM BROWSER IS TOO MUCH TO TAKE.

I'M HOPING I WILL LEARN TO LIVE WITH IT OVER TIME. BUT RIGHT NOW IT FEELS LIKE HELL. WHY ARE BROWSERS STILL DOING THINGS DIFFERENTLY? HTML WAS CREATED 30 YEARS AGO!

AAAAAAAH!

**Update**: I changed the SVG to a high quality PNG. Life is much better now.
