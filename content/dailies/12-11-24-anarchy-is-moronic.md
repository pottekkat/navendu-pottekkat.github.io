I recently discovered anarchists and anarchism. Let me save you some time: It's absolutely moronic.

Anarchists want to remove all existing structures/systems:

{{< blockquote author=" Peter Clayborne" link="https://anarchyemergencelove.substack.com/p/to-change-everything-start-anywhere" title="To change everything, start anywhere" >}}
In order for each person to be free to make their own decisions, there must not be any system of power capable of coercing people into obedience. So the first and most important work of anarchy is dismantling those systems. Skipping ahead to "but what will we put in their place?" belies an anxiety about the removal of those systems — for example, without police how will we keep safe and solve conflicts? Well, that assumes the function of police is to preserve safety and solve conflict. In fact, whenever spaces are wrested from the rule of law, many conflicts cease to exist and many of those that remain tend to be solved much more peacefully.

That's about the dumbest thing I have every heard.

Dear anarchist, these systems you want to dismantle didn't appear out of thin air. We lived in what would be considered an anarchic society and independently (every single civilization) developed these systems to live better.

Another funny thing is that both anarchism and capitalism, the very system they want to remove, are grounded in the same belief: people know how to live their own lives and organize themselves better than any expert could.

No shit Sherlock!

Capitalism has its flaws. But we have to think forward and look for better ways to govern ourselves, not fantasize with your elite anarchists over brunch.

I read a great take on the US elections:

⁠But when you lose vote share across almost every demographic segment to an opponent whose leadership and character flaws were on public display for four years, you must stop blaming the intellect of the electorate and ask yourself how badly you must be doing in their eyes.

This goes for other countries/leaders who seem to be winning despite their flaws. Instead of insulting the intellect of the majority, leaders going out of office should reflect on their performance over their tenure.

[Active preaching of inevitable doom](https://www.techspot.com/article/2908-the-zero-click-internet/) instead of actively working to course correct is pointless. An active community of people is working to build personal blogs and digital gardens, creating an alternate network free from monopolistic control.

Finally, a [great explanation of contexts in Go](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1gn5e2c/what_is_context_in_golang/) and a [related YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2RdcrMLQAo) to clarify.
