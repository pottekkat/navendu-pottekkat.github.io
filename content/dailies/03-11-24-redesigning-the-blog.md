Phew, over the last two weeks, I have been redesigning the blog to make it better for me to write and for my readers to read.

The colors are better, there's now a light theme, and it all looks better on mobile.

I also refactored a lot of code to make it easy to maintain before I restarted writing to avoid migrating later. For example, I have still been using highlight.js to highlight the code snippets, but I have moved to the Hugo native Chroma.

There were also a lot of redundant pages, which I had to remove to keep the builds small and to prevent people from accidentally getting into the wrong pages.

[As mentioned](/dailies/23-10-24-a-worthy-cms/), I'm also using Front Matter, a CMS built into VS Code to manage the content. Writing here has been a lot more fun with the redesign, refactor, and Front Matter.

There's a caveat, though. I spent an irrational amount of time tweaking my blog to look exactly how I wanted it to. It was problematic last week, having regularly missed proper sleep. But now, even though I'm a bit sleep-deprived, I'm pretty proud of how the new design turned out to be. So, a tradeoff?

Tomorrow, I will also publish my first post after the redesign. I have more posts in the pipeline and plan to write more consistently to keep this pipeline filled.

The final task in this whole redesign is to rewrite the content. Everything apart from the posts is likely outdated or needs improvement. So I will be passively at it next week.

What do _you_ think of the new look?
