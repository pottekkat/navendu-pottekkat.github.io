I'm starting a new TIL section (shortly) to share the tiny tidbits I learn daily. This is inspired by Julia Evans, who [recently added a similar section](https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/11/09/new-microblog/) inspired by Simon Willison, [who has had one](https://til.simonwillison.net/) for a long time.

In addition to the inspiration, a TIL section would also be perfect for learnings that don't deserve a full-fledged blog post but don't fit into the daily logs section. It should be a place where I can quickly note down things and easily share them with others (or my future self, who blatantly forgot this shard of knowledge).

Between the blog posts, daily logs, and the TIL section, I should be able to get all my thoughts and actions on paper to document and process by myself and others. All that's left is to be consistent and reduce the barrier for what I consider "worthy" to be published.

Today might be a good start. I'm almost done with work, and I'm using this time to write the logs for today. Coincidentally, I found [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LhmdYa5vvA) that spoke precisely this and made me double down on my promise to write more.
