I have been inactive here for a while, but I have my reasons. I also have reasons to think I might be more active here starting this week. *Deets dropping soon*.

Well, for starters, my writing workflow sucked. My "CMS" was 100 lines of Go code that barely met the thresholds of both a CLI and a CMS. Suffice to say, it took a lot of effort to create, manage, and publish new posts.

Writing the actual post content was even harder. I use Vim (BTW), and while it was great for writing code without leaving the keyboard, it made me feel disconnected from the content. I had to use my notes or other text editors to draft the content, convert it to Markdown, create the correct file using the non-existent CMS CLI, and finally commit and push the file to GitHub to trigger a workflow in Netlify that spits out what you see ([my blog setup](/posts/my-blog-setup-and-writing-process/)).

All that and my limited free time meant my little corner of the Internet didn't receive the care it deserved.

So what changed? Well, for starters, I moved to a new, proper CMS, [Front Matter](https://frontmatter.codes/). It runs in Visual Studio Code AND can be tweaked and extended to fit even this mess I call a website.

Until now, every CMS fell before my mess, and I couldn't do anything to clean it up. Too big but too delicate.

Front Matter seems to be my website's Achilles heel. It took me just over a day to set up a productive environment where I could focus on the content rather than the code.

I will write a detailed blog post soon, but the takeaway is that dear reader, you will see more of me here.
