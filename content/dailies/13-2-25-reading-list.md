I've been reading books. Three currently:

1. **[The Art of Doing Science and Engineering](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/530415.The_Art_of_Doing_Science_and_Engineering) by Richard W Hamming**: A collection of real stories that guides you on the essence of engineering and solving problems taken from the life of Hamming. I'm five chapters down and looking forward to the more hardcore problems later in the book.
2. **[The Nitopadesha](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/75515336-the-nitopadesha) by Nitin Pai**: A translation (a translation of a translation technically) of the ancient Indian book on how the state, market, and society should function together. It's a collection of stories similar to the Panchatantra, and the most surprising thing to me is how aligned its insights are with the modern ideas around economics and public policy.
3. **[Leviathan Wakes](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8855321-leviathan-wakes) by James S A Corey**: Set in a not-so-distant future, this sci-fi novel shows humans as a multi-planetary species, having conquered the solar system and on the verge of deep space exploration. It's interesting to imagine how nations could form and interact with each other and how human problems remain human problems even in the vastness of space.

I'm also trying to stay up-to-date with my RSS feed. The most interesting article I read today was by Julian Lehr titled, "[Signaling as a Service](https://julian.digital/2020/03/28/signaling-as-a-service)," where he writes about how signaling is primitive to humans and how it unfolds in the modern world through easy-to-understand scenarios.
