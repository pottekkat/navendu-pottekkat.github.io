I love people who explore their curiosities. Because of YouTube, such pursuits can be economically feasible today. This is indeed a net benefit to society.

Today, I saw Cleo's video on a "[journey to the center of the Earth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0-ZZ9pLyWw)." Very interesting.

I always wonder how skills like programming are known only by a small fraction of technology users. This can have drastic effects on the Internet we like and love, [as pointed out by Loris Cro](https://kristoff.it/blog/static-site-paradox/), where the web will shrink to a handful of websites if it hasn't happened already. We need more corners like this on the Internet.

I enjoy [3Blue1Brown videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pny70rNPJLk). I wish we had cheaper Internet in India 10 years before it happened. I would have been better positioned to learn what I wanted when I genuinely had the time and curiosity. I now have a shelf full of maths textbooks, and since I will have more time shortly, I should use it to study maths for fun again.


Today, I saw a fascinating book titled "[Slow Down, the degrowth manifesto](https://www.newyorker.com/books/under-review/can-slowing-down-save-the-planet)."

I didn't want to spend time reading what I think is Marxist ideology, but the apparent impact the book had in Japan intrigued me enough to settle for a summary. Like Marxism, it sounds good on paper. But it does not matter if it doesn't work in practice.

Ghostty [looks really cool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlj4dcdWgM). From early reviews of the closed beta, it indeed looks sleek. I might just make the switch on day 1 of its release.
