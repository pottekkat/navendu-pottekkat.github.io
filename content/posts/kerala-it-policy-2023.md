Make this a read through. Quote parts of the document and add your views. For example, the goals of the policy seem to vague and wide. It would be better instead to focus on each specific part.

Start the article with a story. About E K Nayanar visiting Silicon Valley in the aftermath of trade unions striking against computers. Maybe add a photo.

The future of information technology seemed to be perfect for Kerala. This was followed by a series of excellent IT policies that ensured IT education, a thriving open source ecosystem. But 30 years from the visit to california that started it all, Kerala finds itself sub par in almost all metrics concerning the Indian IT industry.

The 2023-24 IT policy presents itself as a gospel to reverse the tide in favor of Kerala. But all that spectale feels to fall short and it just feels like a regurgitated version of the previous iteration of this policy with nothing but bloat.
