Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.

Any advice is only helpful when used as a tool to build a framework for life rather than the framework of life itself. This proves true in a world of abundance, where coming across contradictory pieces of advice is not uncommon. 

A 15-minute scroll through your Instagram or Twitter feed can verify this hypothesis. You will stumble upon self-appointed _gurus_ who swear by their conflicting (_will this go viral?_) advice while blissfully ignoring the acute context where their advice applies. Blindly trusting advice from these gimmick influencers can leave you in loops of conflict or a state of mental gridlock, unable to act on your life.

Being a twenty-one-year-old college graduate does not help either. You are at your most impressionable. You are meandering on your own to carve out a path you think would lead you to the life you want. The untamed sea of advice can quickly drown this twentysomething.

Therefore, any advice should also be met with reasonable skepticism. If you spend a little time thinking, you will realize that most advice is only anecdotal and boils down to "this worked for me, and it _might_ work for you." This isn't inherently bad, but it is important to package the advice in the context in which it worked.

This blog post does not present itself as a set of answers to the unfaltering problems of the twenty-year-olds but as a guide on what questions you can ask yourself to arrive at those answers. I cannot advise you on living your life with what worked for me because it worked for _me_. But it might also work for you, and it is up to you to decide.

The ideal way to read this post is to identify what could work for _you_, salt ðŸ§‚ to _your_ taste, and use it to build a framework for how _you_ want to spend your twenties.

## Mind Your Impressionability

I underestimated how much I would change during my sevenish years at the twentysomething club. Many things I have held fundamental to my identity have now been replaced. It is likely that you, too, will underestimate your own impressionability.

With college, work, dates, and other social environments, your twenties might also be the time when you are among more people than at any other point in your life. Such surroundings can unwittingly influence your life decisions.

To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to change you is the greatest accomplishment.
{{< /blockquote >}}

This is an even greater accomplishment today, as most interactions exist in the _influencer-follower realm_ (problematic for more reasons). The only possible way to completely avoid these external influences might be to bomb-shelter yourself from being a social human being.

However, the practical way is to accept your impressionability and find a sensible middle ground between the _enthusiastic influencee_ and the _reclusive non-conformist_.

I accidentally found my equilibrium during the early days of the pandemic. I quit my job right before the world went into lockdown and took some "time off" to explore my next (ad)venture.

While everyone locked down closer than ever in the popular multiplayer game of that week, in a fortunate misfortune, my phone broke, and I was stuck with myself.

Looking back at this time four years later and on a much better path, it seems obvious that spending time with myself was the single best thing I could have done. It helped me figure out what I actually wanted to do in life and set me on the path I still follow. 

## Fail to Define

A consequence of being young is constantly thinking you have to define yourself to fit the well-designed archetypes of society. I believe this has two causes:

1. You don't know who you are or want to be, _yet_, and instead of making an effort to understand yourself, you conveniently resort to external labels to define yourself. 
2. You see people only through the narrow personas they present to society (which often fit these archetypes) and fail to realize they are complex and multifaceted.

Growing up in Kerala was no help. Everyone here is an "-ist." Whether in politics, philosophy, religion (no religion is a religion here like _[Dinkoists and Dinkoism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinkoism)_), or even books (we still have Marxists), people tend to label themselves in absolutes without even a feel for the grey in between.

You are a complex being with complex emotions and interests. It is ridiculous to think you must force yourself into these neat societal molds.

Similarly, society also makes us believe success is measured on a scale of happiness. While being happy is undoubtedly important, the pursuit of this elusive "happyness" will be riddled with sadness, anger, fear, frustration, and the spectrum of emotions that make us human.

Speaking of emotions, a severe epidemic affecting the current generation of twentysomethings is poor mental health. Managing mental health is often seen as neglected in the past, and the progress we have made as a society in understanding and treating this illness is remarkable.

However, self-diagnosing every difficult emotion as a mental illness will do more harm than good. The moment you label nervousness as anxiety, you start seeing insurmountable challenges instead of overcomable problems. To an extent, this tendency emerges from the familiar identity crisis problems (I'm not negating the fact that many people are seriously ill and require medical help).

It seems like we were too quick to label the older generations as ignorant about mental health. We can correct course by curbing the self-diagnosis trend.

Life only presents beatable challenges. In your early independent years, you won't be conditioned to _easily_ overcome these challenges. But making the effort to confront them will build resilience that no anxiety medications can provide.

## Crippled by Ambitions

Ambitions vary widely depending on your background, interests, and the opportunities you can afford. It is also true that ambition emerges when people have their fundamental needs met. This is why we feel there are more ambitious individuals now than in the pastâ€”where most such endeavors were from the privileged upper-class elites.

_This is also why the argument that countries like India need to focus on building economic safety nets to incentivize people to pursue ambitious goals (like winning gold medals at the Olympics) holds value. We don't want our future Olympians stuck in survival jobs while they could be training. But I digress._

But being ambitious today likely feels more overwhelming than 10 or 20 years ago.

This sense of overwhelm stems from the fact that ambitious people now have significantly more opportunities to make an impactâ€”opportunities that can, paradoxically, become paralyzing.

My ambitions have grown in scope as I got older. But constantly reaching for these ambitious endeavors has often left me crippled, crushed by long-term goals without a clear path to achieving them.

An approach I have found helpful is to think long-term and act short-term. With a north star to guide you, take the immediate action that would bring you a step closer to your goals. For instance, to impact technology policy, the best thing I can do now is to be a technologist and learn about policymaking. Eventually, these small, consistent actions will compound and help me reach my ambitions.

A final word of caution for my ambitious twentysomething readers: being ambitious means nothing without the pursuit. It's like navigating a narrow canyon roadâ€”thrilling and treacherousâ€”where one wrong step, born from a lack of passion, can send your pursuit into a freefall.

## Opportunities Have Costs

{{< blockquote author="Robert Frost" link="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44272/the-road-not-taken" title="The Road Not Taken" >}}
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,\
And sorry I could not travel both\
And be one traveler, long I stood
{{< /blockquote >}}

Every opportunity you pursue comes with the cost of not pursuing anotherâ€”the opportunity cost. Successful people often frame these costs as sacrifices, made in pursuit of something greater. Throughout your twenties, you will make similar decisionsâ€”not necessarily involving sacrificesâ€”having a lasting impact on your future, like picking a career, marrying a partner, choosing friends, and settling on a place to live.

While all these decisions have inevitable costs, the real problem is being fixated on these costs, leading to indecision that prevents you from making any progress. In my early twenties, I was stuck between two career paths, spending the better part of a year trying to pursue both because I couldn't commit to one. _I was jobless for a year_.

{{< /blockquote >}}

It rarely gets simpler. The what-ifs and the could-haves will linger throughout your life. I have come to think of my opportunity costs as lives I'm living parallelly in alternate universes (there is surely a universe where I'm starring in [Vinayan\'s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athisayan) adaptation of the Batman).

Some blame should fall on our educational institutions. As a child, you are limitlessly curious, and your life feels infinitely possible. You go through phases where you would want to be anything from a bus driver to a racer or a movie star to an astronaut, with little regard for feasibility.

Sixteen years of school and college gradually conditions this would-be Formula 1 cosmonaut to narrow their curiosity. You are in narrow streams by high school, and your degrees are even narrower. You expect to live your whole life working at a job with this narrow focus.

This approach to life could have worked in an age of scarcity, where for our parents, pursuing a narrow path meant financial security and stabilityâ€”both rare in their time. So people got teaching degrees and engineering degrees and became teachers and engineers.

But we, the children of the age of abundance, realize after a while on the narrow path that there's a lot more we can do in life. We realize we aren't tied to our degrees or our past selves. We realize we can start again from scratch.

Schools have misrepresented this reality for a long time. It nurtures a false narrative to present fewer opportunities than actual onesâ€”much closer to the range of opportunities we perceive as a child.

The bottom line is that there will always be choices and confusion. It is unreasonable to think that you will pick a path when you are 21 and will forever be interested in following it.

You have been reading this for around 10 minutes. Take a break and listen to this [popular Malayalam song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkDRDlCOqwQ) where the protagonist pleads with the gods to help alleviate his confusion (totally reasonable).

## Money Buys Time

Rich people saying things like "mo money, mo problems" is an age-old tale. The rest of us frown at this attempt at patronization and shout, "That's easy for you to say!"

Well, it is indeed easy because rich people are likely more qualified to give advice on money.

{{< blockquote author="The Notorious Big" link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUhRKVIjJtw" title="Mo Money Mo Problems" >}}
I don't know what they want from me\
It's like the more money we come across\
The more problems we see
{{< /blockquote >}}

While I understand the intent behind the "mo money, mo problems" mantra, for most of us, money still has a positive marginal utility despite diminishing returns, i.e., having a bit more money can be useful when you have less. But for the rich, extra money has fewer tangible benefits.

What money really offers you is time. Time is more valuable than money, but _money buys time_.

To be more precise, money gives you periods of productive leisure (or "[active unemployment](https://www.palladiummag.com/2022/01/06/quit-your-job/)" if you prefer a more compelling term). It affords you the slack needed to pursue your interests rather than grinding a soul-crushing 9-5 (I love my job, BTW).

I used the money I saved in 2019 to build a mental safety net, giving me the confidence and freedom to quit my job, pursue my interests, and transition to my current career.

When you are stuck between opportunities for the fear of opportunity costs, it could be helpful to pick the opportunity that helps you build a similar safety net. This safety net would expand the range of opportunities you can afford later in life.
